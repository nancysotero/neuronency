Research Experience
=====
*Cognitive Neuroscience Lab - Bielefeld University, Bielefeld, Germany July 2023 - Currently
  * PhD Candidate | Scientific worker. Subject: visual-auditory integration, spatial hearing, eye movement-related eardrums oscillations.
* Electrophysiological, vascular/hemodinamic and pupillometric measures in cortical plasticity monitoring of hearing aids adult users - ELS-IIN 2019 - 2023
  * Conducted recordings in electroencephalography (BrainVision), ABR, FFR, ERP, pupillometry (Mangold) and fNIRS (NirX), data acquisition, processing and analysis; participants managment (patients from a hearing rehabilitation service and normal hearing subjects).
* "Absolute Pitch" in music graduation students: is there a relationship with temporal auditory processing? - UFPB, João Pessoa, Brazil 2017 - 2018
  * The aim of this project was to identify the prevalence of absolute pitch among music students and to do a controlgroup comparison in auditory temporal resolution assessment tasks.
  * Conducted psychophysical experimentation on Absolute Pitch, central auditory processing assessment (temporal resolution ability), and music cognition features, data analysis and reporting.
