I have had some trouble describing myself lately. Am I still a speech-pathologist/audiologist who fell in love with neuroscience, or have I transitioned into a neuroscientist permanently captivated by the hearing sciences? 

I'm currently working on my PhD at [Cognitive Neuroscience Group](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/biologie/forschung/arbeitsgruppen/cns/research/audio-visual/index.xml) where I investigate Eye Movement-related Eardrums Oscillations, a novel feature that might clarify interactions between ocular and auricular systems and may help us to make sense of how the brain combines hearing and visual inputs to understand spatial information. Previously I had focussed on bridging the gap between brain activity measurements and routine clinical practice during my [Master's](https://institutosantosdumont.org.br/en/pos-graduacao-neuroengenharia/) and [Residency](https://institutosantosdumont.org.br/en/residencia-multiprofissional/). I've also been involved in projects related to tinnitus, occupational health and music cognition, and I love discussing these topics at any opportunity.       

From either perspective, I keep a single truth to myself: <b>the best way to improve people's happiness starts directly in their ears</b>.
