I have had some trouble describing myself lately. Am I still a speech-pathologist/audiologist who fell in love with neuroscience, or have I transitioned into a neuroscientist permanently captivated by the hearing sciences? 

I'm currently working on my PhD at [Cognitive Neuroscience Group](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/biologie/forschung/arbeitsgruppen/cns/research/audio-visual/index.xml) of Bielefeld University, in Germany, where I investigate Eye Movement-related Eardrums Oscillations, a novel feature that might clarify interactions between ocular and auricular systems and may help us to make sense of how the brain combines hearing and visual inputs to understand spatial information. Previously I had focused on bridging brain activity measurements to for routine clinical practice during my [Master's](https://institutosantosdumont.org.br/en/pos-graduacao-neuroengenharia/) and [Residency](https://institutosantosdumont.org.br/en/residencia-multiprofissional/). I've also been involved in projects related to tinnitus, occupational health and music cognition, and I love discussing these topics at scientific events and other opportunities.       

From either perspective, I keep a single truth to myself: <b>the best way to improve people's happiness starts directly in their ears</b>.
