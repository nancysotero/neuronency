I have had some trouble describing myself lately. Am I still a speech-pathologist/audiologist who fell in love with neuroscience, or have I transitioned into a neuroscientist permanently captivated by the hearing sciences? From either perspective, I keep a single truth to myself: the best way to improve people's happiness starts directly in their ears.
