excerpt: 'Our data support that the EMREO time course is comparable between the left and right ears, and between paradigms guiding saccades by visual and auditory target stimuli, and suggest that the EMREO amplitude is negatively related to the compliance of the tympanic membrane as established by tympanometry. These results support the notion that EMREOs reflect motor-related top-down signals relayed to the ear from yet-to-be-resolved sources, and fuel the speculation that EMREOs may be generated by the middle ear muscles in a differential operation similar to the execution of ipsi- and contralateral saccades.'
